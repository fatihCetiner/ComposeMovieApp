## Compose Movie App üé¨
Compose Movie App is an Android application that fetches and displays movies from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). 
Users can browse a list of movies, view detailed information about each movie, and search for specific films. The app is built using Jetpack Compose and follows the MVVM architecture pattern.

## Features üöÄ
- Movie Listing: Browse a list of movies fetched from the OMDb API.
- Movie Details: View detailed information about selected movies.
- Search Functionality: Search for specific movies by title.
- MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clear separation between the UI and business logic.

## Technologies and Libraries Used üõ†
- Jetpack Compose: For building a declarative and modern UI.
- Retrofit: For making API requests to fetch movie data.
- OkHttp: For handling HTTP requests and logging.
- Coroutine Flow: For managing asynchronous data streams.
- Coil: For loading movie posters and images.
- Dagger Hilt: For dependency injection.
- Compose Navigation: For handling navigation between screens.

## Architecture Details üõ†Ô∏è
- MVVM Architecture:
  <br>
1- ViewModel: Handles UI state and manages interaction with the repository using Coroutine Flow.
  <br>
2- Repository: Fetches data from the OMDb API and provides it to the ViewModel.


- Dependency Injection: Managed with Dagger Hilt for clean and scalable code.
- Navigation: Handled using Compose Navigation for smooth transitions between screens.
